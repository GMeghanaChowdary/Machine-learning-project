# Machine-learning-project
This project uses a machine learning model to classify wheat crop diseases based on environmental and agricultural features such as temperature, humidity, soil type, and fertilizer usage. The dataset is structured (CSV format) and does not use images, making it lightweight and easy to run on any system.
